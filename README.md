## ✅ Rules
- Only push your work inside **your own folder**.
- Do **not** edit or delete files in other folders.
- Keep the repository organized and clean.

## 🔄 Git Workflow

1.  **Clone the repo** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd <repo-name>
    ```

2.  **Always fetch and pull before making changes**:
    ```bash
    git fetch
    git pull origin main
    ```

3.  **Add and commit your changes**:
    ```bash
    git add your-folder/
    git commit -m "Meaningful message"
    ```

4.  **Push your work**:
    ```bash
    git push origin main
    ```

## ⚠️ Reminders

*   Don’t commit unnecessary files.
*   Make sure your code runs before pushing.
*   Communicate with your team if needed.
